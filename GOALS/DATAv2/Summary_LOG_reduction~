Data Reduction and Measurements

The reduction and measurements were made interactively within GBTIDL
(Marganii 2006) using speciallized GBTIDL scripts designed for this
program.  Data were reduce using standard Tsys(ON-OFF)/OFF GBT
calibration spectral line red uction (Braatz 2006).  Scan pairs with
bad baselines were automatically flagged by checking the resulting RMS
levels of the baselines.  The data for each source from all available
sessions were combined. The results for each polarization were reduced
separately and compared visually to verify spectral features.  The
default "TCAL" noise diode levels as a function of frequency were
adjusted to match the calibration measurements derived for this
project using observations of the flux calibrator 3C48 (Perley Butler
2015).  The estimated absolute uncertainty on the resulting
calibration is 10%.

After the data were corrected for atmospheric attenuation using the
internal Observatory weather database and the calibration was
adjusted, the data for the two polarizations were combined and placed
on the flux density scale.  Narrow-RFI channels were removed by
interpolating across the narrow feature.  The data were smoothed by 7
channels (4.5 km/s) using the GSMOOTH Gaussian smoothing routine.  A
low order (3-5) polynomial baseline was removed from the
spectral-bandpass, and the continuum level was recorded.  The RMS of
the line-free regions of the data and the total emission or absorption
was measured by summing over the spectral features.  For sources
showing deep absorption within their emission regions, the negative
absorption channels (after baseline removal) were set to set to zero
to provide a lower limit to the total amount of line emssion.
Gaussian profiles were fitted with a Gaussian profile to derive the
line width at the 50% of the fitted peak, and the GMEASURE routine to
linearly interpolation the outter wings of the profile to derive the
line width at the 20% level.  For non-Gaussian profiles (the majority
of the sources), the edges of the profiles were measured with GMEASURE
to derive both the 50% and 20% line widths.  Similar methods were used
for both the emission and absoprtion profiles.  The measurements were
made interactively by viewing each spectrum and clicking on the
appropriate channels to set the measurement and fitting parameters.
For consistency and to provide a uniform method for making the
measurements, specialize software was developed to streamline the
interactive procedures.

GOALS HI project

AGBT10B14 is copy of data from /molok/disk1 which includes Diana,
Sabrina's and my work over the years.

========
Brief History:

AGBT10B14 project   

2010 Ron helped with observing scripts/methods.

2010 Data taken in 2010 with Diana as an REU student (I did many of the
observations before she arrived).

2011 Sabrina worked with Diana in 2011, additional flagging and RFI
manual removal.

2018 I re-did the reduction to include the continuum level as well as
derived calibration factors in 2018.  I made scripts to carryout
reduction/fitting in a systematic way.

2021 Re-started project  

Copied data to Euler and updated scripts for data paths.


======

Reduction 

dogroups,'reduc2' which uses the auto 0.1rms flags.
Additional flagging manually done.

See OLD/NOTES_2017 for calibration and data reduction/measurement methods.
Can use different flagging files and re-do combination.



Steps for calibration and measurements:

filein,'reduc2/rawpol1.fits'

(0) fit0,sc compare each polarization separately to confirm baseline regions and line features.

(1) fit1,sc  copy to container-10 without replacement to redo RFI removal
Calibrates and combines both polarizations, corrections for ATM.
Does smoothing to make RFI removal easier
plots result


(2) zoom and replace narrow RFI interactively 

Middle mouse button around RFI and use 

replace,bchan,echan to interpolate across RFI, where bchan is first
bad channel and echan is last bad channel

click unzoom button

(3) fit2 does baseline removal with copy of input in container-11 and continuum as container-3

(4) fit3 does measurements with input in container-12 and outputs measurements and ascii spectra

2017 NOTES:


Should correct calibration for noise diodes as function of frequency
for each of the polarizations.

Save combination of each polarization in the reductions.

(1) First step is to flag all the bad data then run dogroups.pro for the data
reduction for one source at a time.

'REDUC/sessions_list' has all the scan numbers per session listed

dogroups.pro is from 2011Apr12

data/AGBT10B_014* is all the raw SDFITS and FLAG files:

I think the "DSG" includes manual flagging by Sabrina.

Use gmeasure.pro to compute area and line center, e.g.,
GBTIDL -> gmeasure,4,0.2,rms=0.01
Click twice to define gmeasure region
click on the positions for the two peaks
                                   Right side fit (a + bx) = 189.28  -0.91
                                    Left side fit (a + bx) = 278.54   1.39
                                   Peaks (right then left) =  75.56  57.60
  Area, Width, Velocity (followed by errors in same order) =   23.59  385.99 5418.61    0.35   13.10    6.55

The latest data may be reduc5 which was copied to REDUC5.  Note that
the brightest continuum sources have all data blanked.... due to
baseline issues.

Used 12.5MHz bandwidth and will adopt average Tcal over 12.5 MHz, so

Tcal uses central 80% of band for tcal value (i.e. +/-5MHz). Derive
Tcal on ~0.5 MHz increment smooth/decimate by ~20channels
Then 10MHz is additional smoothing by 20x.

reduc2 uses auto flagging of rms > 0.1
REDUC/sessions.list updated to include last sessions (last session=35)
run dogroups,'reduc2'  (with auto 0.1rms flags updated for all data)
infile,'reduc2/rawcombine1.fits'

Some manual editting needed, but offline flagging by Sabrina/Diana too
aggressive and removes too much data.

Auto flags:
FLAGS_0.1rms

FLAG versions:
FLAGS_0.1rms AUTO flagging
FLAGS_DSG  (similar to FLAGS_0.1rms in many cases)
FLAGS_DSG_v2 manually flagging based on baselines (but subtle may be ok)
FLAGS_DSG_v3 removes some of the flags in v2 less aggressive

Start with FLAGS_DSG_v3 and remove subtle baselines flags even "Huge
RFI" flagged data are ok (many times RFI near edge of band and not
affecting line

Start with FLAGS_0.1rms version and re-do manual flagging based on
summations.

288 F21453 ABS with emission wings.  Measure Emission and zero out ABS
and treat as lower limit.  We may want to measure ABS and emission
separately.  Emission with ABS, measure emission and quote lower
limit.  Pure ABS lower limit uncertain due to Ts/(Ts - Tc), and Tc can
be very large for non-thermal radio emission.  Ts cold medium~80K and
warm medium 500K.  Thermal Tc would be 5000-10000K (and compute
example for non-thermal)  Adopt approximation of Ts/(Ts-Tc)~0.01?!?.
Or look at radio source sizes.

----------reminder----
Steps for calibration and measurements:

filein,'reduc2/rawpol1.fits'

(0) fit0,sc compare each polarization separately to confirm baseline
regions and line features.

(1) fit1,sc copy to container-10 without replacement to redo RFI
removal Calibrates and combines both polarizations, corrections for
ATM.  Does smoothing to make RFI removal easier plots result


(2) zoom and replace narrow RFI interactively 

Middle mouse button around RFI and use replace,bchan,echan to
interpolate across RFI, where bchan is first bad channel and echan is
last bad channel

click unzoom button

(3) fit2 does baseline removal with copy of input in container-11 and
continuum as container-3

(4) fit3 does measurements with input in container-12 and outputs
measurements and ascii spectra

Reduction log at FINAL/LOG_reduction
---------------

312 F23365+3604  Strong narrow feature in one of the polarizations at high
velocity, not tabulated.  Source has weak absorption which was
measured.

314 F23394

316 F23436  Baseline ripple at low velocity side, but ok at source velocity.
cut bad data out when plotting

    150     150    2850
150 Sources with _v1.txt files from default reduction 
and 12 sources requiring more work

Differences between reduc2 and other versions??

reduc2 used for 150 sources reduc5 looks ok for some with previous bad baselines
reduc5 more aggessive removal and cleans up several more sources.

Keep reduc5 results separate from reduc2 results

Default reduct2 txt files in DATAv1



2021.08.26
Reduce using reduc5 saving in the FINAL area


GBTIDL -> filein,'reduc5/rawpol1.fits'

Compare reduc2 vs reduc5 for marginal reduc2 results


 ASCII file written:FINAL/F23436+5257_v1.txt

316 source measurements are consistent.

318 reduct5 only small set remaining -- look at other reductions to
confirm high-velocity feature.

 cp -r FINAL DATAv2

All current reductions of 3c84 have all data blanked.  Need to reduce
these data separately by first removing all the flags.
 
Blank flags

/data/scratch/dfrayer/GOALS/AGBT10B14/data

The different reduc version correspond to the flags

I think possibly
FLAGS_0.1rms ==> reduc2
FLAGS_DSG  reduc3?
FLAGS_DSG_v2 reduc4?
FLAGS_DSG_v3 reduc5?
FLAGS_diana  reduc1?
FLAGS_default = FLAGS_0.1rms
