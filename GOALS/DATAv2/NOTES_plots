Make 3x5 plots per page.

Need to set x.range and y.range interactively per source.

Do not save the edges in the delivered data when making the ascii files

Loop through gbtidl script to show sources and set x-y ranges and
print out values for IDL ploting input file

Smoothing the data to 4.5km/s [7channels]'

print,!g.s[0].source

c1 = click()

c2= click()

print,!g.s[0].source, c1.x,c1.y,c2.x,c2.y,c1.chan,c2.chan

(1) use getpltranges.pro  to get plot ranges of the data for each source
0-50 done (note some duplicates that need cleaning)
getpltranges,51,...

(2) use pmulti.pro to make pages of plots.

(3) (use similar to pmulti to make the ascii data files [cutting off
     the edges and showing only data that are plotted)


Want to have 2 sets of x-ranges.  One for the plots and one for the
output ascii data.  Should zoom in on the detected line
emission/absorption.  If continuum is less than 5-sigma, then remove
continuum level for plot.      

Need to clean up some RFI replacement regions in the baseline still
for some sources.   Make version 2.
